theme-generator
===============

Script to create a theme/color scheme based on an image or a base color. ".Xresources" and ".i3/config" themes are planned to be supported initially.

Use https://gist.github.com/coleifer/33484bff21c34644dae1 for a completed project similar to what I'm making. This is currently just a learning experience of git and python for me,

Currently doesn't do anything...
